<b>PROJECT BACKGROUND:</b>
<p>In Scotland, smoking and alcohol are two of the most important preventable causes of ill-health and premature death: one in every five deaths is attributable to tobacco 
and one in 20 to alcohol. The neighbourhood availability of tobacco and alcohol products has been implicated in promoting smoking and drinking behaviours. In CRESH we have been 
investigating the links between tobacco and alcohol and tobacco environments and health. You could see more details of our current work <a href="https://cresh.org.uk/">here</a>.
We have developed this tool as part of the <a href="https://spectrum.ed.ac.uk/">SPECTRUM Consortium</a> to publicise our research and make it more accessible to the public and 
policy makers. The <a href="https://spectrum.ed.ac.uk/">SPECTRUM Consortium</a> is a multi-university, multi-agency research consortium focused on the commercial determinants 
of health and health inequalities. SPECTRUM Consortium is funded by the UK Prevention Research Partnership.</p>

<p>In this webmap, you will be able to map the most recent alcohol and tobacco outlet count data for small neighbourhoods across Scotland between 2012 and 2020. Data on neighbourhood
deprivation and health related outcomes are available to display in this mapper. Data sources and definitions of each variable will appear in the aside panel of the map when you complete
a variable selection. The website is free to use and the data are also free upon request. In future developments, we will allow a data download option. Similarly, data will be updated
periodically.</p>

<p>On this page we describe the information that can be displayed and downloaded through the webmap site. For more information about the proyect please contact Prof. Jamie Pearce at
